Making a career switch can be quite daunting especially if the switch is between two 
career paths at both ends of the spectrum.

I began the transitioning about two years - moving from a medical career path to a software engineering path. 
I believe a Master's degree in Medical Informatics cushioned a lot of the impact I would have experienced otherwise.
